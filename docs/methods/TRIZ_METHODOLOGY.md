# TRIZ Methodology for Participatory Democracy

## Introduction

TRIZ (Russian: Теория Решения Изобретательских Задач, "Theory of Inventive Problem Solving") is a systematic methodology for innovation and creative problem-solving. Originally developed for engineering challenges, we adapt it here for resolving contradictions in participatory democracy and public policy.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to TRIZ methodology and its application to the Audierne2026 contribution consolidation process.

## History and Origins

### Genrich Altshuller (1926-1998)

TRIZ was developed by **Genrich Saulovich Altshuller**, a Soviet engineer, inventor, scientist, and science-fiction author (under the pen name Genrich Altov).

**Key milestones:**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1926 | Born in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR |
| 1940 | At age 14, received his first patent (underwater breathing device) |
| 1946 | Began developing TRIZ while working in the Soviet Navy's Patent Department |
| 1948 | Wrote letter to Stalin criticizing Soviet invention system |
| 1950 | Arrested and sentenced to 25 years in Siberian gulag |
| 1954 | Released after Stalin's death |
| 1956 | Published first article on TRIZ |
| 1969 | Published "Algorithm of Invention" |
| 1984 | Published "And Suddenly the Inventor Appeared" |
| 1989 | Founded the TRIZ Association |
| 1998 | Died in Petrozavodsk, Russia |

### The Research Foundation

Altshuller's methodology was built through systematic analysis of **over 200,000 patents** from which he identified:

- Patterns of inventive solutions
- Common types of contradictions
- Recurring problem-solving strategies
- Evolution trends of technical systems

His insight: **Most inventions solve similar types of problems using similar strategies**, regardless of the field. If we could identify and codify these strategies, we could teach inventive thinking systematically.

> "You can wait a hundred years for enlightenment, or you can solve the problem in 15 minutes with these principles."
> — Genrich Altshuller

## Core Philosophy

### The TRIZ Worldview

1. **Contradictions are the source of problems**
   - Every significant problem contains a contradiction
   - Solving the contradiction = solving the problem

2. **Contradictions can be resolved, not just traded off**
   - Traditional thinking: compromise (improve A by sacrificing B)
   - TRIZ thinking: transcend (improve A AND preserve B)

3. **Innovation patterns are repeatable**
   - Most inventive solutions follow recognizable patterns
   - These patterns can be learned and applied systematically

4. **Problems are similar across domains**
   - A solution in biology may apply to architecture
   - Cross-domain thinking accelerates innovation

### The Ideal Final Result (IFR)

A key TRIZ concept is imagining the **Ideal Final Result**:

> "The ideal system is one that doesn't exist, but its function is performed."

This means:
- Maximum benefit with minimum resources
- The problem solves itself
- No trade-offs, no side effects

When analyzing problems, always ask: *What would the ideal solution look like if there were no constraints?*

## Types of Contradictions

### Technical Contradictions

**Definition:** Improving one aspect of a system leads to deterioration of another aspect.

**Structure:**
```
IF we [action to improve Parameter A]
THEN [Parameter A improves]
BUT [Parameter B deteriorates]
```

**Examples:**

| Improvement | Deterioration | Domain |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Increase aircraft speed | Increase fuel consumption | Aviation |
| Make software feature-rich | Make software complex to learn | Technology |
| Increase public participation | Increase decision-making time | Democracy |
| Preserve heritage buildings | Limit urban development | Urban planning |

### Physical Contradictions

**Definition:** A single element must simultaneously have opposite properties.

**Structure:**
```
Element X must be [Property A] to achieve [Function 1]
AND
Element X must be [NOT Property A] to achieve [Function 2]
```

**Examples:**

| Element | Must be... | And also... | Domain |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Coffee | Hot (enjoyment) | Cool (safety) | Consumer |
| Meeting | Long (thorough) | Short (efficient) | Business |
| Participation | Anonymous (honest) | Identified (accountable) | Democracy |
| Policy | Flexible (adaptive) | Consistent (fair) | Government |

### Resolving Physical Contradictions

TRIZ offers four separation principles:

1. **Separation in Time**
   - Element has Property A at time T1, Property B at time T2
   - *Example:* Retractable landing gear (present during landing, absent during flight)

2. **Separation in Space**
   - Element has Property A in location L1, Property B in location L2
   - *Example:* Pencil (hard graphite core, soft wood exterior)

3. **Separation in Scale**
   - Element has Property A at macro level, Property B at micro level
   - *Example:* Foam (solid at macro, air at micro)

4. **Separation by Condition**
   - Element has Property A under condition C1, Property B under condition C2
   - *Example:* Shape-memory alloy (flexible when cold, rigid when heated)

## The Contradiction Matrix

### How It Works

The Contradiction Matrix is a 39×39 table that maps:
- **Rows (Y-axis):** Parameter to improve
- **Columns (X-axis):** Parameter that worsens
- **Cells:** Suggested Inventive Principles (1-4 per cell)

### Using the Matrix

**Step 1:** Identify the technical contradiction
```
Improving [Parameter A] causes [Parameter B] to worsen
```

**Step 2:** Find parameters in the matrix
- Locate improving parameter in rows
- Locate worsening parameter in columns
- Find intersection cell

**Step 3:** Read suggested principles
- Cell contains 1-4 principle numbers
- Research each principle
- Apply creatively to your problem

**Step 4:** Generate solutions
- Don't take principles literally
- Interpret abstractly for your domain
- Combine multiple principles

### Example Application

**Problem:** Increasing public participation (more voices heard) increases decision-making time (slower governance).

**Contradiction:**
- Improving: Parameter #39 (Productivity) → more citizen input processed
- Worsening: Parameter #25 (Loss of time) → slower decisions

**Matrix suggests:** Principles 10, 37, 14, 28

| Principle | Interpretation for Democracy |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| #10 Preliminary action | Pre-gather input before formal decisions |
| #37 Thermal expansion (relative change) | Scale participation to issue importance |
| #14 Spheroidality (curves) | Use iterative, cyclical consultations |
| #28 Mechanics substitution | Replace meetings with digital platforms |

## TRIZ for Social Innovation

### Extending TRIZ Beyond Engineering

While TRIZ was developed for technical problems, researchers have successfully applied it to:

- Business and management problems
- Social policy challenges
- Organizational design
- Service innovation
- Sustainability and environmental issues

### Key Adaptations

**1. Reinterpreting Parameters**

Technical parameters can be translated to social equivalents:

| Engineering Parameter | Social/Policy Equivalent |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| Weight | Resource burden, complexity |
| Speed | Response time, agility |
| Strength | Resilience, durability of policy |
| Reliability | Consistency, predictability |
| Ease of operation | Accessibility, usability |
| Adaptability | Flexibility to changing needs |
| Productivity | Outcomes per resource invested |
| Harmful factors | Unintended consequences |

**2. Social Contradiction Types**

| Contradiction Type | Example |
|-------------------|---------|
| Equity vs. Efficiency | Fair distribution vs. optimal allocation |
| Participation vs. Speed | Inclusive process vs. timely decision |
| Autonomy vs. Coordination | Local freedom vs. system coherence |
| Innovation vs. Stability | New approaches vs. proven methods |
| Transparency vs. Privacy | Open government vs. data protection |

**3. Liberating Structures "TRIZ"**

The facilitation method "Liberating Structures" includes a simplified TRIZ exercise:

> "Make a list of all you can do to make sure that you achieve the worst result imaginable... Then go down the list and ask: 'Is there anything we're currently doing that resembles this counterproductive activity?'"

This "inverse TRIZ" helps groups identify and eliminate counterproductive practices.

### Implementation in Consolidation Script

Our `consolidate_contributions.py` script detects these patterns by:

1. Scanning contribution text for keywords
2. Counting co-occurrences of contradiction indicators
3. Flagging contributions with multiple opposing keywords
4. Suggesting TRIZ-inspired resolution workshops

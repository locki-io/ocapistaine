[auth]
# Password for accessing OCapistaine public instance
# Can be plain text or hashed (sha256:hexdigest)
#
# To generate a hashed password:
#   poetry run python -c "from app.auth import hash_password; print(hash_password('your-password'))"
#
# Example (plain text - less secure):
# password = "your-secret-password"
#
# Example (hashed - more secure):
# password = "sha256:5e884898da28047d9c2a18104731bd8e1b7f5d4f3e6b6b7c3d2e1f0a9b8c7d6e"
password = ""

# Optional: List of allowed users (for future multi-user support)
# allowed_users = ["jnxmas"]
